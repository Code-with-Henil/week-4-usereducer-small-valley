# useReducer

-   You compulsarily have to use `useReducer` hook.
-   You can install dependencies like React Router, Styling Libraries, etc if needed.

## Question: Todo List

1. Create a React App: Set up a new React application using create-react-app or your preferred method. Also set up styles with your preferred choice.

2. Set up a useReducer function to manage the state of the todo list. Define actions for adding, marking as complete, and removing todos.

3. Create the user interface with your choice for the todo list, allowing users to add new todos, mark them as complete, and remove them.

4. Dispatch actions to the reducer based on user interactions to update the state of the todo list.

## Basic Todo Object:

    todo: {
        task: "Learn Angular.js",
        isComplete: false
    }

-   You can add more fields if you want to.
